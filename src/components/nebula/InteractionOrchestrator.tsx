// InteractionOrchestrator removed
// This file was a minimal mouse-position throttler used by the old custom cursor system.
// The orchestrator has been removed as part of cursor cleanup. If you need a similar
// throttled mouse hook in the future, reintroduce a small hook that calls a provided
// callback on mousemove.
